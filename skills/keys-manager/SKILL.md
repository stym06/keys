# Keys Manager

A skill for managing API keys and secrets locally using the `keys` CLI tool.

## Installation

The `keys` CLI must be installed first:

```bash
brew install stym06/tap/keys
```

Or with Go:

```bash
go install github.com/stym06/keys@latest
```

## Commands

### Store a key

```bash
keys add <name> <value>
```

If the key already exists, the user is prompted to overwrite, edit, or cancel.

### Retrieve a key

```bash
keys get <name>       # print value directly
keys get              # interactive typeahead picker
```

### Browse keys interactively

```bash
keys see
```

Opens a TUI with fuzzy search, checkboxes, clipboard copy, and age indicators.

- `space` — toggle selection
- `tab` — copy selected as `KEY=VAL`
- `ctrl+y` — copy selected as `export KEY=VAL`
- `ctrl+e` — export selected to `.env` file
- `enter` — add a new key (when no matches found)
- `esc` — quit

### Masked view

```bash
keys peek
```

Same as `see` but values are hidden as `***`. Press `r` to reveal individual keys. Useful for screen-sharing.

### Edit a key

```bash
keys edit <name>
```

Opens a TUI editor. `tab` switches fields, `enter` saves, `esc` cancels.

### Delete a key

```bash
keys rm <name>
```

### Export keys

```bash
keys env              # interactive selector, writes .env file
keys expose           # print export statements to stdout
```

### Import from .env

```bash
keys import <file>
```

Parses `.env` files — handles comments, quotes, and `export` prefixes. Reports new vs updated counts.

### Profiles

Isolate keys by project or environment:

```bash
keys profile use <name>     # switch profile
keys profile list           # list all profiles (* = active)
```

All `add`, `get`, `rm`, `see`, and other commands operate within the active profile.

### Delete all keys

```bash
keys nuke
```

Requires typing `nuke` to confirm. Only affects the active profile.

## Examples

### Typical workflow

```bash
keys add OPENAI_KEY sk-proj-abc123
keys add STRIPE_KEY sk_test_4eC3
keys get OPENAI_KEY
keys see                    # browse and copy
keys env                    # generate .env for a project
```

### Multi-project setup

```bash
keys profile use projectA
keys import .env
keys profile use projectB
keys add DB_HOST prod-db.example.com
keys profile list
```

### Quick export to shell

```bash
eval $(keys expose)
```

## Guidelines

- Always use `keys get <name>` when the user knows the exact key name
- Use `keys get` (no args) when the user wants to search/pick interactively
- Use `keys peek` instead of `keys see` when the user is screen-sharing or wants masked output
- Use `keys profile` to separate keys across different projects or environments
- Use `keys import` for bulk loading from existing `.env` files
- Suggest `keys env` when the user needs to generate a `.env` file for a specific project
